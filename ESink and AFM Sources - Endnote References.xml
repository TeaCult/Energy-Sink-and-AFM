The non-contact AFM offers unique advantages over other contemporary scanning probe techniques such as contact AFM and scanning tunneling microscopy, especially when utilized for reliable measurements of soft samples (e.g., biological species). Current AFM imaging techniques are often based on a lumped-parameters model and ordinary differential equation (ODE) representation of the micro-cantilevers coupled with an adhoc method for atomic interaction force estimation (especially in non-contact mode). Since the magnitude of the interaction force lies within the range of nano-Newtons to pica-Newtons, precise estimation of the atomic force is crucial for accurate topographical imaging. In contrast to the previously utilized lumped modeling methods, this paper aims at improving current AFM measurement technique through developing a general distributed-parameters base modeling approach that reveals greater insight into the fundamental characteristics of the microcantilever-sample interaction. For this, the governing equations of motion are derived in the global coordinates via the Hamilton's Extended Principle. An interaction force identification scheme is then designed based on the original infinite dimensional distributed-parameters system which, in turn, reveals the unmeasurable distance between AFM tip and sample surface. Numerical simulations are provided to support these claims</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Lan, Kuo-jung</author><author>Yen, Jia-yush</author><author>Lee, Chih-kung</author><author>Lin, Yi-ming</author><author>Chen, Cheng-hung</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>an Afm Probe Controller Design Based an Afm Probe Controller Design Based</title></titles><periodical/><pages>12-19</pages><volume>7</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords><keyword>and pid control</keyword><keyword>atomic force microscope</keyword><keyword>high performance control for</keyword><keyword>multiplicative uncertainty</keyword><keyword>such a probe sys-</keyword><keyword>the afm</keyword><keyword>µ -synthesis</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2005</year></dates><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://AFM Control - Probe Controller Design.pdf</url></pdf-urls></urls></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Rajendra Kumar, R T</author><author>Hassan, S U</author><author>Sardan Sukas, O</author><author>Eichhorn, V</author><author>Krohs, F</author><author>Fatikow, S</author><author>Boggild, P</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Nanobits: customizable scanning probe tips.</title><secondary-title>Nanotechnology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Nanotechnology</full-title></periodical><pages>395703</pages><volume>20</volume><keywords/><dates><year>2009</year></dates><isbn>0957-4484</isbn><accession-num>19724112</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1088/0957-4484/20/39/395703</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://AFM Innovative - customaziable scanning probe microscope.pdf</url></pdf-urls></urls><abstract>We present here a proof-of-principle study of scanning probe tips defined by planar nanolithography and integrated with AFM probes using nanomanipulation. The so-called 'nanobits' are 2-4 microm long and 120-150 nm thin flakes of Si(3)N(4) or SiO(2), fabricated by electron beam lithography and standard silicon processing. Using a microgripper they were detached from an array and fixed to a standard pyramidal AFM probe or alternatively inserted into a tipless cantilever equipped with a narrow slit. The nanobit-enhanced probes were used for imaging of deep trenches, without visible deformation, wear or dislocation of the tips of the nanobit after several scans. This approach allows an unprecedented freedom in adapting the shape and size of scanning probe tips to the surface topology or to the specific application.</abstract></record><record><database

acoustical holography (NAH) to measure an area that fully covers the source, a set of so-called patch NAH methods has been introduced. One such method is the statistically optimized NAH (SONAH). In this method, the acoustic quantities on a mapping surface near the measurement surface are calculated by using a transfer matrix defined in such a way that all propagating waves and a weighted set of evanescent waves are projected with optimal average accuracy. The present paper gives an overview of the basic theory of SONAH, including a description of phenomena such as spatial aliasing and wave-number domain leakage. A revised and generalized mathematical formulation is given, covering the calculation of all three components of particle velocity and the use of up to six virtual source planes. A set of formulas for the inherent estimation error level of the method is derived and used to visualize the regions of validity of the SONAH predictions for some typical microphone array geometries. The sensitivity of the inherent error level distribution to changes in the parameters of the SONAH algorithm is also investigated.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><titles><title>Akiyama-Probe (A-Probe) technical guide</title><secondary-title>Nanotechnology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Nanotechnology</full-title></periodical><keywords/><dates><year>2009</year></dates><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://AFM Instrument - akiyama-probe_technicalguide_2009mar23.pdf</url></pdf-urls></urls></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Coupling, Energy Domain</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>ANSYS Multiphysics Capabilities for MEMS Modeling and Simulation</title></titles><periodical/><pages>20-22</pages><volume>3</volume><issue>2</issue><keywords/><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://AFM Instrument - Capacitive AFM for Electrostatic Structures.pdf</url></pdf-urls></urls></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Akiyama</author><author>Technology, Patented</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Akiyama-Probe (A-Probe) guide</title></titles><periodical/><keywords/><dates><year>2008</year></dates><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://AFM Instrument- Our Probe akiyama-probe_guide_2008nov17.pdf</url></pdf-urls></urls></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Heck, John</author><author>Adams, Donald</author><author>Belov, Nickolai</author><author>Chou, Tsung Kuan A</author><author>Kim, Byong</author><author>Kornelsen, Kevin</author><author>Ma, Qing</author><author>Rao, Valluri</author><author>Severi, Simone</author><author>Spicer, Dean</author><author>Tchelepi, Ghassan</author><author>Witvrouw, Ann</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Ultra-high density MEMS probe memory device</title><secondary-title>Microelectronic Engineering</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Microelectronic Engineering</full-title></periodical><pages>1198-1203</pages><volume>87</volume><issue>5-8</issue><keywords><keyword>AuSn bonding</keyword><keyword>Bulk micromachining</keyword><keyword>CMOS-MEMS integration</keyword><keyword>Cantilever</keyword><keyword>Microelectromechanical systems (MEMS)</keyword><keyword>Poly-SiGe</keyword><keyword>Probe storage</keyword><keyword>Surface micromachining</keyword><keyword>Wafer bonding</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2010</year></dates><publisher>Elsevier B.V.</publisher><isbn>0167-9317</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.mee.2009.12.014</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://AFM Multi Tip -  mem device.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.mee.2009.12.014</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>We have demonstrated a MEMS memory device utilizing an array of cantilevered AFM probe tips fabricated directly on standard CMOS, and integrated with a ferroelectric media on a movable platform by wafer bonding.

Although early work with single probes was justifiably assessed as being too slow to practically apply in a nanomanufacturing context, we have recently demonstrated throughputs up to 3x10(7) microm(2)/h--in some cases exceeding e-beam lithography--using centimeter square arrays of 55,000 tips tailored for Dip Pen Nanolithography (DPN). Parallelizing DPN has been critical because there exists a need for a lithographic process that is not only high throughput, but also high resolution (DPN has shown line widths down to 14 nm) with massive multiplexing capabilities. Although previous methods required non-trivial user manipulation to bring the 2D array level to the substrate, we now demonstrate a self-leveling fixture for NanoInk's 2D nano PrintArray. When mounted on NanoInk's NLP 2000, the 55,000 tip array can achieve a planarity of &lt;0.1 degrees with respect to the substrate in a matter of seconds, with no user manipulation required. Additional fine-leveling routines (&lt;2 min of user interaction) can improve this planarity to &lt;0.002 degrees with respect to the substrate-a Z-difference of less than 600 nm across 1 cm(2) of surface area. We herein show highly homogeneous etch-resist nanostructure results patterned from a self-leveled array of DPN pens, with feature size standard deviation of &lt;6% across a centimeter square sample. We illustrate the mechanisms and methods of the self-leveling fixture, and detail the advantages thereof. Finally, we emphasize that this methodology brings us closer to the goal of true nanomanufacturing by automating the leveling process, reducing setup time by at least a factor of 10, enhancing the ease of the overall printing process, and ultimately ensuring a more level device with subsequently homogeneous nanostructures.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Bayat, Dara</author><author>Akiyama, Terunobu</author><author>de Rooij, Nicolaas F.</author><author>Staufer, Urs</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Dynamic behavior of the tuning fork AFM probe</title><secondary-title>Microelectronic Engineering</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Microelectronic Engineering</full-title></periodical><pages>1018-1021</pages><volume>85</volume><issue>5-6</issue><keywords><keyword>2DOF system</keyword><keyword>Atomic force microscope</keyword><keyword>Tuning fork</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2008</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.mee.2008.01.100</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://AFM Simulation - Akiyama Probe.pdf</url></pdf-urls></urls><abstract>We recently introduced a new self-actuating and self-sensing atomic force microscope (AFM) probe based on a quartz tuning fork and a micro-fabricated cantilever. This system has two degrees of freedom, associated with its two components. We developed a model for describing how the sample-tip interaction is transduced to the tuning fork. It is based on two coupled spring-mass systems. In a first step, the coupling between the tuning fork and the cantilever was investigated to reveal the influential factors. The analysis of these factors enabled us to deduce their effect on the whole system and to optimize the sensitivity of this novel probe. The theoretical analysis was compared with experimental results and it was found that the model appropriately describes the probe in a qualitative manner while further refinement will be needed for achieving a correct quantitative description. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

However, this can be a slow process when the user is interested in studying non-uniform samples, because existing contact- and dynamic-mode methods require that the measurement be performed at one fixed surface point at a time. This paper proposes an AFM method based on dual frequency modulation using two cantilevers in series, which could be used to measure the tip-sample interaction force curves and topography of the entire sample with a single surface scan, in a time that is comparable to the time needed to collect a topographic image with current AFM imaging modes. Numerical simulation results are provided along with recommended parameters to characterize tip-sample interactions resembling those of conventional silicon tips and carbon nanotube tips tapping on silicon surfaces.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Gotszalk, Teodor</author><author>Grabiec, P.

The FEM simulation is performed by means of the ANSYS 5.3 code. The developed probe consists of a micromachined silicon cantilever beam with an integrated micro-tip and piezoresistive sensors for detecting the lateral and vertical forces acting on the tip. The sensitivity for vertical displacement detection of 1.26 μV/nm (for 1 kΩ piezoresistor) and for lateral displacement detection of 0.46 μV/nm (for 0.7 kΩ resistors), by 0.6 V applied supply voltage was obtained. The principle of the probe, theoretical analysis, and experimental investigation of the probe sensor are discussed. The probe is suitable for operating in contact and noncontact atomic force microscopy (AFM) mode. The probe was utilized for imaging the surface of a chromium/quartz structure. © 2005 Elsevier B.V.

In this letter, the authors present the conditions necessary for a continuous AFM probe to be faithfully represented as a point-mass model, and derive the equivalent point-mass model for a general eigenmode of arbitrarily shaped AFM probes based on the equivalence of kinetic, strain, and tip-sample interaction energies. They also demonstrate that common formulas in dynamic AFM change significantly when these models are used in place of the traditional ad hoc point-mass models.

Analytical/numerical models that can accurately simulate the surface-coupled dynamics of the cantilever are essential for quantitative/qualitative understanding/explanation of measured results. In this paper, a comprehensive finite element model is developed for numerical simulation of free and surface-coupled dynamics of tip-cantilever system in dynamic modes of AFM. Representing the cantilever by three-dimensional beam elements, this model can simulate all the cantilever dynamic modes within a framework of the standard finite element method. Formulations reflecting the exact excitation mechanisms are derived for tapping mode (TM), torsional resonance (TR) mode, and lateral excitation (LE) mode. Under tip-sample interaction, the location/geometry of the tip and the tilting of the cantilever to the sample surface become important and can be easily addressed in this model. With the application of this finite element model, in TM, we show that phase shift of cantilever response and interaction force sensitively depend on in-plane mechanical properties but it is not true for cantilever vibration amplitude. The excitation of higher-order modes of vertical bending is observed in our simulation and its influence on data acquisition and interpretation is discussed. In TR and LE modes, torsion and lateral bending of the cantilever are coupled. We investigate how the torsion and lateral bending contribute to the twist of the cantilever and demonstrate that the lateral bending contribution can be ignored only if the lateral interaction is relatively weak compared to the cantilever stiffness of lateral bending. Tip eccentricity, if any, strongly affects amplitude and phase of cantilever responses and therefore cannot be ignored in TR and LE modes. The differences of TR and LE modes due to their different excitation mechanisms are also discussed. The presented model is capable of accurately simulating the cantilever dynamics under complex tip-sample interaction and might be used for quantitative extraction of surface properties. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

The variation of the dissipated energy on a surface by a vibrating tip as a function of its amplitude has a shape that singles out the dissipative process. The method is illustrated by calculating the dynamic-dissipation curves for surface adhesion energy hysteresis, long-range interfacial interactions and viscoelastic processes. We also show that by diving the dissipated energy by its maximum value, the dynamic-dissipation curves become independent of the experimental parameters.

Though there are several difficult issues for the theoretical simulations in liquids, the authors introduce here the simulation methods for the cantilever oscillation in liquids and the tip-sample interaction force mediated by water molecules. As for the cantilever motion, a very efficient numerical method is proposed which solves the oscillation of the elastic beam cantilever and fluid dynamics simultaneously. The results reproduce fairly well the resonant curve and related properties of the Si beam cantilever. As for the simulation of the tip-sample interaction force in water, classical molecular dynamics (MD) method is adopted in the present work.

Our focus is on understanding why the changes observed in the dynamic properties of a vibrating tip that interacts with a surface make possible to obtain molecular resolution images of membrane proteins in aqueous solutions or to resolve atomic-scale surface defects in ultra high vacuum (UHV). Our description of the two major dynamic AFM modes, amplitude modulation atomic force microscopy (AM-AFM) and frequency modulation atomic force microscopy (FM-AFM) emphasises their common points without ignoring the differences in experimental set-ups and operating conditions. Those differences are introduced by the different feedback parameters, oscillation amplitude in AM-AFM and frequency shift and excitation amplitude in FM-AFM, used to track the topography and composition of a surface. The theoretical analysis of AM-AFM (also known as tapping-mode) emphasises the coexistence, in many situations of interests, of two stable oscillation states, a low and high amplitude solution. The coexistence of those oscillation states is a consequence of the presence of attractive and repulsive components in the interaction force and their non-linear dependence on the tip–surface separation. We show that key relevant experimental properties such as the lateral resolution, image contrast and sample deformation are highly dependent on the oscillation state chosen to operate the instrument. AM-AFM allows to obtain simultaneous topographic and compositional contrast in heterogeneous samples by recording the phase angle difference between the external excitation and the tip motion (phase imaging). Significant applications of AM-AFM such as high-resolution imaging of biomolecules and polymers, large-scale patterning of silicon surfaces, manipulation of single nanoparticles or the fabrication of single electron devices are also reviewed. FM-AFM (also called non-contact AFM—NC-AFM) has achieved the long-standing goal of true atomic resolution with AFM in UHV. Our analysis starts with a discussion of the relation between frequency shifts and tip–surface interactions, emphasising the ability of perturbation theory to describe the measured frequency shift. We discuss the role of short-range chemical interactions in the atomic contrast, with particular attention to semiconductor and ionic (alkali halides and oxides) surfaces. Also included is a detailed quantitative comparison between theoretical simulations and experiment. Inversion procedures, the determination of the tip–sample interaction from the frequency shift versus distance curves above specific sites, are also reviewed. We finish with a discussion of the optimal range of experimental operation parameters, and the use of damping (excitation amplitude) as a source of atomic contrast, including the possible interpretation in terms of microscopic dissipation mechanisms.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Stuckling, Stephan</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Atomic Force Microscopy for Industry with the Akiyama Probe Sensor</title><secondary-title>IEEE ASSP Magazine</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>IEEE ASSP Magazine</full-title></periodical><pages>4244</pages><volume>1</volume><keywords><keyword>-atomic force microscopy</keyword><keyword>akiyama-probe</keyword><keyword>b</keyword><keyword>ease of manipulation</keyword><keyword>ease of use</keyword><keyword>gaining perceived ease of</keyword><keyword>industry</keyword><keyword>quartz</keyword><keyword>the second step in</keyword><keyword>tuning fork</keyword><keyword>use for</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2002</year></dates><isbn>1424415047</isbn><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://Akiyama new.pdf</url></pdf-urls></urls></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Raman, Arvind</author><author>Melcher, John</author><author>Tung, Ryan</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Cantilever dynamics in atomic force microscopy Dynamic atomic force microscopy , in essence , consists of a vibrating</title><secondary-title>Review Literature And Arts Of The Americas</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Review Literature And Arts Of The Americas</full-title></periodical><pages>20-27</pages><volume>3</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2008</year></dates><isbn>1748-0132</isbn><electronic-resource-num>0.1016/S1748-0132(08)70012-4</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://Cantilever dynamics in AFM.pdf</url></pdf-urls></urls><abstract>Dynamic atomic force microscopy, in essence, consists of a vibrating microcantilever with a nanoscale tip that interacts with a sample surface via short- and long-range intermolecular forces. Microcantilevers possess several distinct eigenmodes and the tip-sample interaction forces are highly nonlinear. As a consequence, cantilevers vibrate in interesting, often unanticipated ways; some are detrimental to imaging stability, while others can be exploited to enhance performance. Understanding these phenomena can offer deep insight into the physics of dynamic atomic force microscopy and provide exciting possibilities for achieving improved material contrast with gentle imaging forces in the next generation of instruments.

Under certain circumstances, for example, when the tip radius is relatively large (e. g. R &gt; 20 - 30 nm) and for high cantilever free amplitudes (e. g. A0 &gt; 40 - 50 nm), the L state can be reached with relatively low set-points only (e. g. Asp/A0 &lt; 0.30). We find that these cases do not generally lead to higher resolution but increase the background noise instead. This is despite the fact that the imaging can be non-contact under these conditions. The appearance of background noise is linked to increasing cantilever mean deflection and tip-surface proximity with increasing free amplitude in the L state</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Study, I</author><author>Freq, Optimum</author><author>Systems, Dist</author><author>Systems, Optimum</author><author>Frequency, Optimum</author><author>Systems, Dist</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>I .

A different but complementary approach is based on analysing the energy that is dissipated when the tip periodically interacts with the sample surface. This method does not require solving the differential equation of motion for the oscillating cantilever, but is based entirely on the analysis of the energy flow in and out of the dynamic system. Therefore the problem of finding a realistic model to describe the tip–sample interaction in terms of non-linear force–distance dependencies and damping effects is omitted. Instead, it is possible to determine the energy dissipated by the tip–sample interaction directly by measuring such quantities as oscillation amplitude, frequency, phase shift and drive amplitude. The method proved to be important when interpreting phase data obtained in tapping mode, but is also applicable to a variety of scanning probe microscopes operating in different dynamic modes. Additional electronics were designed to allow a direct mapping of local energy dissipation while scanning a sample surface. By applying this technique to the cross-section of a polymer blend a material specific contrast was observed.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Norris, A</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Nanomechanics</title></titles><periodical/><keywords/><dates><year>2004</year></dates><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://Pethica_IMPRS.pdf</url></pdf-urls></urls></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Melcher, John</author><author>Kiracofe, Daniel</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>VEDA 2 . 0- Virtual Environment for Dynamic Atomic Force Microscopy</title></titles><periodical/><keywords/><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://VEDA_Simulator Tool for AFM.pdf</url></pdf-urls></urls></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Celik, Ce</author><author>Akay, Adnan</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Dissipation in solids: thermal oscillations of atoms</title><secondary-title>The Journal of the Acoustical Society of America</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>The Journal of the Acoustical Society of America</full-title></periodical><pages>184-91</pages><volume>108</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2000</year></dates><accession-num>10923883</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1121/1.429455</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://Dissipation in Solids.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10923883</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Dissipation in solids describes conversion of kinetic energy to thermal energy. Heat capacity of a solid relates to the kinetic energy of the oscillations of its atoms with the assumption that they are in thermal equilibrium. Previous studies investigated criteria related to thermal relaxation, the process by which thermal equilibrium is established. They examined conditions for irreversible distribution of energy among the modes of a nonlinear periodic structure that represents atoms in a solid. These studies all point to the chaotic behavior of a freely vibrating nonlinear lattice as the kernel of the problem in addressing thermal relaxation. This paper extends the results of previous studies on thermalization to modeling of dissipation as energy absorption that takes place during forced vibration of particles in a nonlinear lattice. Results show that dissipation and chaotic behavior of the particles develop simultaneously. Such behavior develops when the forcing frequency falls within a resonance band. The results also support the argument that for a real solid, both in terms of size and complexity, resonance bands overlap significantly broadening the frequency range within which dissipation takes place.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Roveri, N</author><author>Carcaterra, a</author><author>Akay, a</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Energy equipartition and frequency distribution in complex attachments.</title><secondary-title>The Journal of the Acoustical Society of America</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>The Journal of the Acoustical Society of America</full-title></periodical><pages>122-128</pages><volume>126</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2009</year></dates><accession-num>19603869</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1121/1.3147502</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://Energy equipartition and frequency distribution in complex.pdf</url></pdf-urls></urls><abstract>As reported in several recent publications, an undamped simple oscillator with a complex attachment that consists of a set of undamped parallel resonators can exhibit unusual energy sharing properties. The conservative set of oscillators of the attachment can absorb nearly all the impulsive energy applied to the primary oscillator to which it is connected. The key factor in the ability of the attachment to absorb energy with near irreversibility correlates with the natural frequency distribution of the resonators within it. The reported results also show that a family of optimal frequency distributions can be determined on the basis of a variational approach, minimizing a certain functional related to the system response. The present paper establishes a link between these optimal frequency distributions and the energy equipartition principle: optimal frequency distributions are those that spread the injected energy as uniformly as possible over the degrees of freedom or over the modes of the system. Theoretical as well as numerical results presented support this point of view.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Koç, I.

A prototypical energy sink envisioned here consists of a set of oscillators attached to, or an integral part of, a vibrating structure. The oscillators that make up an energy sink absorb vibratory energy from a structure and retain it in their phase space. In principle, energy sinks do not dissipate vibratory energy as heat in the classical sense. The absorbed energy remains in an energy sink permanently ?or for sufficiently long durations? so that the flow of energy from the primary structure appears to it as damping. This paper demonstrates that a set of linear oscillators can collectively absorb and retain vibratory energy with near irreversibility when they have a particular distribution of natural frequencies. The approach to obtain such a frequency distribution is based on an optimization that minimizes the energy retained by the structure as a function of frequency distribution of the oscillators in the set. The paper offers verification of such optimal frequency spectra with numerical simulations and physical demonstrations.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Akay, Adnan</author><author>Xu, Zhaoshun</author><author>Carcaterra, Antonio</author><author>Koç, I.

Energy sinks consist of a set of undamped linear oscillators and, in principle, do not require presence of damping in the classical sense. The set of undamped oscillators that make up an energy sink collectively absorb the vibratory energy and retain it in their phase space. Earlier optimization studies by the authors have shown the feasibility of vibration absorption and energy retention by energy sinks if the set of oscillators have a particular frequency distribution. Experimental results presented in this paper support the concept of energy sinks. Different physical realizations of energy sinks demonstrate the significance of frequency distributions and the ability of energy sinks to reduce vibration amplitude of a primary structure to which they are attached.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Magionesi, F.</author><author>Carcaterra, A.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Insights into the energy equipartition principle in large undamped structures</title><secondary-title>Journal of Sound and Vibration</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Sound and Vibration</full-title></periodical><pages>851-869</pages><volume>322</volume><issue>4-5</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2009</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.jsv.2008.11.038</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://Insights intotheenergyequipartitionprincipleinlarge.pdf</url></pdf-urls></urls><abstract>The question of energy sharing among complex engineering vibrating systems is still an open problem. On the basis of some recent investigations, this paper is addressed to the prediction of the equilibrium energies of interacting conservative resonators and to a better understanding of the principle of energy equipartition for large undamped systems. The analysis explores the field of linear and nonlinear vibrations, the effects of inhomogeneity, the weak or the strong coupling as well as the effect of the initial energy distribution among the subsystems. The principle of energy equipartition is shown to react in a different fashion to these factors. Some general arguments, supported by the results of numerical experiments, enlightening promoting or inhibiting factors to the reaching of energy equipartition conditions, are given. ?? 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Recent studies have shown that energy can be introduced to a linear system with near irreversibility, or energy within a system can migrate to a subsystem nearly irreversibly, even in the absence of dissipation, provided that the system has a particular natural frequency distribution. The present work introduces a general theory that provides a mathematical foundation and a physical explanation for the near irreversibility phenomena observed and reported in previous publications. Inspired by the properties of probability distribution functions, the general formulation developed here is based on particular properties of harmonic series, which form the common basis of linear dynamic system models. The results demonstrate the existence of a special class of linear nondissipative dynamic systems that exhibit nearly irreversible energy exchange and possess a decaying impulse response. In addition to uncovering a new class of dynamic system properties, the results have far-reaching implications in engineering applications where classical vibration damping or absorption techniques may not be effective. Furthermore, the results also support the notion of nearly irreversible energy transfer in conservative linear systems, which until now has been a concept associated exclusively with nonlinear systems.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Carcaterra, Antonio</author><author>Akay, Adnan</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Transient energy exchange between a primary structure and a set of oscillators: Return time and apparent damping</title><secondary-title>The Journal of the Acoustical Society of America</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>The Journal of the Acoustical Society of America</full-title></periodical><pages>683</pages><volume>115</volume><issue>2</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2004</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1121/1.1642619</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://transient energy exchange.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>http://link.aip.org/link/JASMAN/v115/i2/p683/s1&amp;Agg=doi</url></web-urls></urls></record></records></xml>
